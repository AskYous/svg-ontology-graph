# svg-ontology-graph

**Warning: It seems there are some bugs when Chrome 64 was released. The arrow heads have an incorrect position.**

A [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) written in TypeScript using a series of [vertices](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphVertex.html) and [edges](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphEdge.html). The edges are unweighted so this is essentially an adjancy list.

See the live demo [here](https://askyous.github.io/svg-ontology-graph/)! Please use Chrome for now. It hasn't been tested on other browsers.

This project is under the MIT license. If you plan to use it, let me know and I can list your project in this README.md as a great example!
